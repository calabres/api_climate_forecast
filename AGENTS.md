# AI & MCP Workflow Documentation

## Overview
This project was developed using an **Agentic AI Workflow**, leveraging an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) acting as an autonomous developer. The development process followed the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** principles, where the AI agent interacts with the local development environment through a standardized set of tools.

## AI Tools & Workflow

### 1. The Agent (Antigravity)
The core of the development was an AI Agent capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks. The agent acted as a "Pair Programmer", receiving high-level objectives from the user and translating them into concrete code actions.

### 2. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Usage
The system interacts with the environment using a toolset analogous to MCP. The Agent does not hallucinate edits; it strictly uses defined tools to manipulate the codebase.

#### Key MCP Tools Used:
*   **`read_resource` / `view_file`**: To ingest the context of existing code (Django views, HTML templates, NetCDF processing scripts).
*   **`run_command`**: To generate real-time diagnostics, install dependencies, and run the development server (`python manage.py runserver`).
*   **`replace_file_content`**: To perform surgical edits on specific code blocks (e.g., refactoring the `get_best_models` function logic).
*   **`write_to_file`**: To create new modules like the `AGENTS.md` documentation or diagnostic scripts.

### 3. Development Workflow
1.  **Context Ingestion:** The Agent analyzed the `data_bsas` directory structure and the NetCDF file metadata using diagnostic scripts (`debug_nc.py`).
2.  **Iterative Refactoring:**
    *   *Problem:* The app displayed empty charts because operational files were missing.
    *   *Agent Action:* Diagnosed the missing files and implemented a "Fallback Logic" in `analysis.py` to automatically select the next best available model.
3.  **Real-Time Validation:** The Agent ran the Django server and verified the API responses using `curl` and browser interactions (simulated via user feedback).

## Automated Features Implemented by AI
*   **Auto-Discovery of Latest Forecast:** The system automatically scans the filesystem for the most recent `operational_*.nc` file to set the forecast baseline.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Implemented logic to handle missing data points (gaps) and ensemble data dimensions (averaging multiple forecast members).
*   **Smart UI Generation:** The AI generated the HTML/JS for the dynamic "Smart Forecast" chart using Chart.js, incorporating tooltip logic and visual calibration.
